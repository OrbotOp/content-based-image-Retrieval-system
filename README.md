# content-based-image-Retrieval-system
## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to continue the process of learning how to manipulate and analyze images at a pixel level. In addition, this is the project where we will be doing matching, or pattern recognition.

The overall task for this project is, given a database of images and a target image, find images in the data with similar content. For this project we will not be using neural networks or object recognition methods. Instead, we will focus on more generic characteristics of the images such as color, texture, and their spatial layout. This will give you practice with working with different color spaces, histograms, spatial features, and texture features.

# System Requirements

    Operating System: Ubuntu
    Software: CMake, Make, Terminal, Sublime Editor

# File Structure

The following files should be kept in the same folder:

    CMakeList.txt
    main.cpp
    functions.h
    olympus (image directory)

# Execution Instructions

To run the code, execute the following commands:

    cmake .
    make

This will create the executable file which can be executed by the following command:

    ./main <Directory path> <task number>

# Tasks

   1. Baseline Matching
   2. Histogram Matching
   3. Multi-histogram Matching
   4. Textture and color Matching

Make sure to replace <Directory path> and <task number> with the appropriate values for your use case.
